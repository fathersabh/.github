## WELCOME TO FATHER SABH GIT LEARNING PLATFORM

Father Sabh Git Learning Platform is an open-source project aimed at providing a comprehensive and extensible framework for Git learning. We focus on testing repositories and actively review new pull requests and merge requests to create a collaborative environment for skill development.

## OVERVIEW

The platform comprises a set of data types, an attribute dictionary, and a taxonomy. While not limited to the cybersecurity domain or events, our initial emphasis has been on creating a schema for cybersecurity events. Father Sabh Git Learning Platform is agnostic to storage format, data collection, and ETL processes. The core schema for cybersecurity events is designed to be implementation-agnostic and is defined using JSON.

Refer to the white paper "Understanding Father Sabh Git Learning Platform" for an introduction to the platform and schema. Explore the cybersecurity schema at [Father Sabh Schema](https://fathersabh.io/schema) to navigate the schema, apply profiles and extensions, and browse attributes, objects, and event classes.
